      Crafted using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project brings forth an interactive web application that hosts an engaging two-player dice game. Participants take turns rolling a dice, with each roll adding to their current score. The game presents a pivotal choice after each roll: players can either roll again to increase their score or update their current score to their cumulative tally. A twist in the game emerges when a dice roll results in a one, leading to an immediate reset of the current score. The ultimate objective is to be the first to amass a score of 100 points.
